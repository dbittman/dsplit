# dsplit
Speedrun split timer in D.

I'm learning to speed run some games, and I wanted to track my times per stage. Unfortunately, the existing software only runs on windows (and the ones that run on osx don't seem to work / are not maintained). I am also learning to write in D, so I figured this would be a decent project for that.

It is an ncurses based interface.
